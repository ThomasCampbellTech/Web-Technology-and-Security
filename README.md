Project: Secure Social Networking Prototype (“Friendzone”)
I developed a secure, responsive social‑networking prototype using PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap, designed to function seamlessly across both mobile and desktop interfaces. The system was built with a strong emphasis on usability, accessibility, and modern web design principles, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
The platform enables users to register, authenticate securely, create and manage posts, interact with other users, and maintain personal profiles. All features were implemented with security best practices in mind, including protection against SQL injection, cross‑site scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication patterns.
Key Features
• 	Responsive Web Interface:
Designed and implemented a fully responsive UI using Bootstrap, adapting layouts and navigation for mobile and desktop clients while maintaining consistent functionality.
• 	User Registration & Authentication:
Built a secure account creation system enforcing unique email addresses and password hashing. Implemented a secure login workflow aligned with modern authentication practices.
• 	User Profiles:
Enabled users to create and edit personal profiles, including a short biography and contact details.
• 	Post Creation & Management:
Developed functionality for users to create posts (up to 280 characters), automatically timestamped and displayed in reverse chronological order. Implemented the ability for users to delete their own posts.
• 	Commenting System:
Added the ability for logged‑in users to comment on any post across the platform, supporting user interaction and engagement.
• 	Global Feed & User Pages:
Built pages to display all posts from all users (most recent first), as well as individual user pages showing their posts and associated comments.
• 	Form Validation & Data Integrity:
Implemented client‑side and server‑side validation using JavaScript and PHP to ensure data quality and prevent malformed input.
• 	Security Controls:
Applied secure coding practices throughout, including prepared statements, input sanitisation, and output encoding to mitigate SQL injection and XSS risks.
Technologies Used
• 	Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery
• 	Backend: PHP
• 	Database: MySQL
• 	Security: Password hashing, prepared statements, input sanitisation, XSS protection
• 	Other: Responsive design, accessibility considerations, form validation
